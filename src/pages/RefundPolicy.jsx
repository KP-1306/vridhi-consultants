          <p>
            At <strong>VridhI Consultants</strong>, we invest significant
            professional time and effort into every assignment. This Refund &
            Cancellation Policy explains how fees and refunds are handled for
            different types of services.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Consultation fees</h2>
          <p>
            Fees paid for one-time consultations, meetings or advice sessions
            are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once the session has been
            scheduled or delivered.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Professional service fees</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For assignments such as registrations, GST or income-tax
              compliances, accounting, audits and ROC filings, fees are charged
              based on the estimated effort and complexity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once we have started work (for example, review of documents,
              preparation of workings or filing of forms), fees are generally{" "}
              <strong>non-refundable</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If work has not yet started and you request cancellation, we may,
              at our discretion, refund a part of the professional fees after
              deducting administrative charges.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Government fees and third-party charges</h2>
          <p>
            Any government fees, portal charges, stamp duty, penalties, late
            fees or payments to third-party service providers are{" "}
            <strong>strictly non-refundable</strong>, as these are paid to
            external authorities or vendors and are outside our control.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Delay or rejection by authorities</h2>
          <p>
            We do not guarantee approval of registrations, applications or
            assessments, as these are subject to government verification and
            discretion. Fees are charged for our professional time and
            expertise, and are not contingent on the outcome. No refund will be
            provided solely on the ground of delay or rejection by authorities.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Service dissatisfaction</h2>
          <p>
            If you are unhappy with any aspect of our service, please raise it
            with us at the earliest. We will review the matter and attempt to
            resolve it. In exceptional cases, we may consider a partial credit
            for future services, purely at our discretion.
          </p>

          <h2>6. How to request a refund</h2>
          <p>
            Refund requests, if any, must be sent in writing to{" "}
            <a href="mailto:info@vridhiconsultants.com">
              info@vridhiconsultants.com
            </a>{" "}
            with full details of the payment, invoice number and reason for the
            request. We may ask for additional information to process your
            request.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Policy updates</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. The latest
            version will be available on our website and will apply to new
            engagements going forward.
