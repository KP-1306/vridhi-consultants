            This Service Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) sets out the terms on
            which <strong>VridhI Consultants</strong> (&quot;we&quot;,
            &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) provide professional services to
            you (&quot;Client&quot; or &quot;you&quot;). By engaging us, you
            agree to these terms in addition to any written proposal, email
            confirmation or engagement letter shared with you.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Scope of services</h2>
          <p>
            The scope of work will be described in our proposal, email or
            engagement letter. This may include services such as business setup,
            registrations, GST and income-tax compliances, accounting, audit
            support, ROC/MCA filings, payroll, labour compliance and advisory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any work not specifically mentioned in the agreed scope will be
            treated as <strong>out of scope</strong> and may require a separate
            fee quote.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Client responsibilities</h2>

              explanations required to perform the services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Share records on time so that statutory due dates for returns and

            </li>
            <li>
              Review workings, returns and reports shared by us and highlight

            <li>
              Ensure that all commercial decisions (pricing, contracts, funding,
              etc.) are taken by you and not solely based on our general advice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Professional fees and payment terms</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our fees will be communicated in writing (proposal / email /
              invoice). Government fees, portal charges, stamp duty, penalties
              and third-party costs are charged <strong>extra</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fees are typically payable in advance or as per milestone /
              monthly schedule mentioned in the proposal.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of delay in payment, we reserve the right to pause work,
              withhold reports and decline to file returns or forms.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Timelines and dependencies</h2>
          <p>
            We make reasonable efforts to meet promised timelines. However,
            timelines may depend on:
          </p>

            <li>

          <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>

            required by law or by any statutory / regulatory authority.
          </p>

          <h2>6. No guarantee of outcome</h2>
          <p>
            Professional services involve judgement and dependency on
            third-party authorities. While we strive for accuracy and
            compliance, we do not guarantee specific outcomes such as issue of
            registrations, completion of assessments in your favour, loan
            sanctions, or absence of any future notices.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            Our total liability, if any, arising out of any engagement will be
            limited to the professional fees actually paid by you to us for the
            specific assignment giving rise to the claim. We will not be liable
            for any indirect, consequential or special loss including loss of
            profit, loss of opportunity or loss of goodwill.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Term and termination</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>

              until terminated by either party.
            </li>
            <li>
              Either party may terminate the engagement by written notice if the
              other party commits a material breach or fails to cooperate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon termination, you agree to pay for services rendered and
              expenses incurred up to the date of termination.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>9. Communication</h2>
          <p>
            Most communications, updates and working papers may be shared
            through email, messaging platforms or cloud tools. You are
            responsible for keeping your contact details updated with us.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>

            This Agreement is governed by the laws of India. Any disputes will
            be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of
